Building on Dylan H Rossâ€™s research, we experimented with various SVR models by investigating features like polarization, chemical fingerprints, 
and data cleaning algorithms to predict CCS values. we am also developing deep learning architectures, exploring autoencoders, GNNs, linear neural networks, 
and K-Means clustering.
